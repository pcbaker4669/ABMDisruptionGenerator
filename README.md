Run with your current baseline and produce 4 strong figures:

Here are my goals for the base model
mastery end vs class size
time_lost_avg vs class size
incidents vs class size
insights on tipping points and non-linearities

the next upgrade will be teacher teaches multiple periods + fatigue 
(one addition at a time).

note on agency: (Agency (A) = “learning conversion / self-directed engagement”)
Agency acts like a student-level “conversion efficiency” for instruction.
It widens gaps: high-agency students climb faster; low-agency students lag, 
and under disruption they can stagnate or decline because forgetting isn’t reduced.

If you allow A to update over time (your V2), this creates feedback: success 
boosts A → more learning → more success; 
failure lowers A → less learning → more failure.

note on behavior: (Behavior (B) = “disruption propensity”
